A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network information
For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry. 


n Ethernet networks, each network interface controller has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) addressâ€”usually stored in the controller's permanent memory
o avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness
The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.
