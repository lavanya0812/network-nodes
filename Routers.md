Routers
A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet.
he routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets and does not require broadcasting packets which is inefficient for very big networks.
