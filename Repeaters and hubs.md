Repeaters and hubs
A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it.
The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation
In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.

Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. 
This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function.
As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule. 

An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub.
In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.
